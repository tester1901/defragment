# defragment
A tool to flood a phishing sites with false data to prevent hackers and scammers from getting real information. As of now the program is held
together using duct tape. It's most likely going to fail if you run it "as is" without changing the order of the payload variable on line 18 to fit the
order of the site. 

## install

$ git clone https://github.com/tester1901/defragment.git

$ cd defragment

you can run it by using;

$ python3 main.py

## future plans
- make the program more reliable
- include rust for speed (only coming when good reliability is achived)
